    <h1>Summary</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>In our research paper titled "Attitudes Towards AI in the Workplace: A Qualitative Study of Highly Skilled Workers' Perspectives," we investigate the attitudes of highly skilled workers towards artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace. We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of these attitudes to understand the impact of AI-related job insecurity on this specific group.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Until recently, technological changes have devalued the skills of less trained workers, whose jobs involve routine tasks that are more easily automated than complex tasks. However, highly disruptive AI-enabled technologies like generative AI threaten to devalue the work of skilled, highly educated employees. Negative attitudes toward AI may undermine its effectiveness and utilization in organizations. These negative attitudes may pose challenges to integration of AI into work processes, which may threaten a companyâ€™s competitive advantage. Moreover, negative attitudes may be detrimental to the health, safety, and job satisfaction of workers in occupations where AI is being used.</p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>We employed a qualitative approach and collected data from participants on the Prolific online data crowdsourcing platform. Our participants were highly skilled workers who held a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. We gathered responses from 217 participants regarding their concerns and perspectives on AI taking over their jobs. Our data analysis involved a general inductive approach, allowing themes and categories to emerge from the responses.</p>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>Our findings highlight five major themes that categorize highly skilled workers' attitudes towards AI in the workplace. Firstly, the theme of "Human-AI Teamwork" reveals varying perspectives on the feasibility and potential benefits of collaboration between humans and AI. While some participants view AI as a tool to handle repetitive tasks and enhance creativity, others express concerns about skill decay and overreliance on AI. Trust is identified as a crucial factor for successful integration.</p>

    <p>The second theme, "AI Ethics," explores participants' perceptions and concerns regarding the ethical implications of AI in the workplace. While some believe AI can remove human bias and improve fairness, there are worries about favoring wealthy corporations, algorithmic bias, and the need for further research on AI fairness.</p>

    <p>The third theme, "AI Warmth," focuses on workers' negative perceptions of AI's ability to demonstrate interpersonal warmth, social skills, and humanness. Optimistic views in this regard were not observed in our study.</p>

    <p>The fourth theme, "AI Competence," highlights the participants' beliefs about AI's knowledge, skills, and abilities. Responses show both optimism and pessimism about AI's capabilities, with discussions about tasks that AI can or cannot currently perform.</p>

    <p>The final theme, "Unemployment," captures participants' fears of job loss and concerns about the impact of AI on their career prospects. While some participants express confidence in their irreplaceability due to their skills, others feel hopeless and worry about their skills becoming obsolete.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Our study contributes to the development of a comprehensive taxonomy of attitudes towards AI in the workplace among highly skilled workers. The findings indicate that workers' concerns revolve around collaboration with AI, AI ethics, warmth, competence, and job security. Organizations aiming to successfully integrate AI should address these concerns by fostering trust, considering ethical implications, and providing ongoing skills training to ensure that workers are equipped for rapidly changing skill demands in the current and future labor market. We emphasize the need for ongoing research and attention to these crucial areas when incorporating AI-enabled systems into the workplace.</p>
